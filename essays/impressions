Knowing html may be good enough for the purposes of just displaying information on the screen, but most of the time, it does not give impression that the site is attractive to viewers. impressions are important. For example, if you are selling any product either retail or online, you want people to have good impressions about your product. In order to give good impressions to the world, it is necessary to make viewers want to read and scroll down the screen to learn more about your page. Ability to make the site attractive is very important especially in the world today where many people rely on internet for variety of purposes. 

<a src="https://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a> is a modern development framework generated by LESS and jQuery that is meant to give an easier experience for developers to design websites. UI semantics use descriptive language for classes which is closer to plain English. There are two main features that makes UI Semantics unique, one of which is how the framework is structured. It uses five main categories to define components: UI Element, Collection, View, Module, and Behavior. These categories have variations and types to let a design unique. Another unique feature of Semantic UI is that it provides special features that are not found in other frameworks. It also allows us to see our design directly in the web, so we can see exactly what we are doing at the moment. 

In my ICS 314 class, we are learning how to utilize Semantic UI to create a web page. So far, we have only learned enough to mimic the appearance of another wen page. One of the things I have noticed learning Semantic UI is that it is straight forward and the classes are very easy to understand, as it is supposed to be. I have not yet learned how to build a more detailed and delicate web page using Semantic UI, but so far it feels that you just need a minimal effort to try and use the framework in satisfactory. The main feature that I like about it is that it provides a source code for the categories they provide, so we can use the code to implement in your code in order to use the item you want on your website. 

In my very little experience I had so far with Semantic UI, I personally think that it is to my benefit overall to learn it because giving good impressions about what ever you create is important, especially as a software engineer. In order to learn how to create an attractive site, the strongest benefit of using Semantic UI in my eyes is that it is easy to use. Learning this simple and easy framework would not just save my time, but it would also help me to build an attractive website.
