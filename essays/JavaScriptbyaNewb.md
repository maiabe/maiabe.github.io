<h1>Misconceptions</h1>

Before learning how to program in JavaScript, I learned that there are misconceptions held by many developers about JavaScript. One of the misconceptions is that JavaScript is not a real programming language. That is incorrect, JavaScript indeed is a real programming language often used to develop web browsers. Perhaps the misconception exists because JavaScript is one of the easiest languages to learn. We need to remind ourselves that programming languages were created so that people can have a easier way to communicate with computers. It is only logical to think that JavaScript enables us to meet such a goal, although I cannot be certain enough to have concrete reasonings to determine if JavaScript is good or bad with my inexperience. 

<h1>My experience with JavaScript comparing it to Java</h1>

Another misconception held is that JavaScript is related to Java. After taking one year of the CS courses, the only language I am familiar with so far is Java, but I need to be careful comparing both languages because the two are completely unrelated. There are however similarities between Java and JavaScript, except the latter is much simpler. I personally like the fact that there are less restrictions in JavaScript than Java. For example, being able to declare variables without having to declare the data types, as well as being able to insert various data types in one array would likely enable us to do much more with JavaScript. 

<h1>Learning JavaScript through Athletic Software Engineering</h1>

In order to experience whether I can really do much more with JavaScript or not, I will learn more about JavaScript through Athletic Software Engineering. Athletic Software Engineering is a high-intensity and time-constrained method of acquiring competency with software engineering skills designed by Dr. Philip Johnson at University of Hawaii at Manoa ([Athletic Sofware Engineering](http://philipmjohnson.org/essays/ase-2017.html)). In ICS 314, which applies this method of teaching, there are assignments called “WOD” (work out of the day), which we need to complete within a set amount of time. 
My biggest concern about WOD is that there is a time restriction, since my two greatest weaknesses are working under pressure and time management. One reason for this is because I take a longer amount of time than most people to read and understand the problems in general. I do not like to blame it on my background, but English is my second language. Therefore, being graded with time restriction is very stressful for me. On the other hand, tackling these problems will help me overcome my two weaknesses. When I was working as a sales associate, I was always under pressure of having to make the minimum sales of the day. Despite the pressure, I was able to turn the pressure into good results. So for this course, I hope to overcome my weaknesses in the same way. Specifically, for WODs, I will take it as one of the challenges that I need to overcome and an opportunity to conquer my weaknesses.
