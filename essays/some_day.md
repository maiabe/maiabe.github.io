<h1>Motivated to make money</h1>

As a child, I was lucky enough that my parents cared very much about my education, so I went to good schools that helped foster me to be an open-minded person. My parents didn’t earn a lot of money, but it was their priority to send their kids to good schools no matter how difficult financially it was. When I was 19 years old, I learned that my family could no longer support me financially to go to school. At that time, I was working as a waitress at a resident lounge in Tokyo. I was making a decent amount of money despite my experience, thanks in part to my education listed on my resume. However, I did not want to settle at that because I could not say that I like doing what I do to make money. So it became my goal to finish a 4-year college on my own to be able to get a better job. I was motivated to make more money as time went by because I had to pay for my tuition also. Over the last five years, I worked as a waitress, worked at an office doing some miscellaneous duties, and worked as a sales associate. 


<h1>How I gained interest in computer science</h1>

Being in a business environment and meeting people through work allowed me to gain knowledge about today’s technology and business. When I first heard and read about a person named Elon Musk, I was fascinated by the fact that there was somebody who is creating things through technology and succeeding to make the world better. I gained more interest about computers and technology as I researched more about his companies such as Tesla, SpaceX, Solar City and the Boring Company. Recently, I am also interested in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Every time, I ask myself wouldn’t it be nice if I knew how to create algorithms to mine coins that keep making money on its own…. Such topics inspire me to make more money efficiently. 

Of course being able to do things such as this is beyond the reach at the moment, but knowing about what is out there in the world today encouraged me to change my major to computer science. Prior to my decision, I was declared as an economics major because I could have graduated in a shorter amount of time compared to many of the other majors. Majoring in computer science definitely hurts me financially at this moment, but I decided to choose a harder path believing it will pay off in the future. 


<h1>After taking the first year of CS courses</h1>

I learned that programming can cause a lot of headaches especially when you get stuck writing codes. However, you feel accomplished when you do get it right, and make the computer do what you want it to do. I enjoy facing challenges and work hard to accomplish them. So far, I am enthusiastic to learn more about programming through software engineering class, and face more challenges to accomplish them.
