<h1>As a Software Engineer</h1>

We encounter people asking questions everyday. In school, somebody may ask, "Do we have a final exam?" You will probably be told to go and look at the course syllabus in response. Questions like this implies that the person has not put any effort to search for an answer themselves. Those who really want to learn would invest the time and energies to answer the question through whatever means necessary, or at least until they ran out of options. To become a skilled and resourceful software engineer, we want to continually learn no matter how many times we run into a wall. In order to continue doing so, we need to be able to ask smart questions that invoke high-quality answers that we can enchane our knowledge with. 




<h1>How I gained interest in computer science</h1>

Being in a business environment and meeting people through work allowed me to gain knowledge about today’s technology and business. When I first heard and read about a person named Elon Musk, I was fascinated by the fact that there was somebody who is creating things through technology and succeeding to make the world better. I gained more interest about computers and technology as I researched more about his companies such as Tesla, SpaceX, Solar City and the Boring Company. Recently, I am also interested in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Every time, I ask myself wouldn’t it be nice if I knew how to create algorithms to mine coins that keep making money on its own…. Such topics inspire me to make more money efficiently. 

Of course being able to do things such as this is beyond the reach at the moment, but knowing about what is out there in the world today encouraged me to change my major to computer science. Prior to my decision, I was declared as an economics major because I could have graduated in a shorter amount of time compared to many of the other majors. Majoring in computer science definitely hurts me financially at this moment, but I decided to choose a harder path believing it will pay off in the future. 


<h1>After taking the first year of CS courses</h1>

I learned that programming can cause a lot of headaches especially when you get stuck writing codes. However, you feel accomplished when you do get it right, and make the computer do what you want it to do. I enjoy facing challenges and working hard to accomplish them. So far, I am enthusiastic to learn more about programming through software engineering class, and face more challenges to accomplish them.
