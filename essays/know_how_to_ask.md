<h1>As a Software Engineer</h1>

We encounter people asking questions everyday. In school, somebody might ask, “Do we have a final exam?” You will probably be asked to go and look at the course syllabus for such question. Questions like this implies that the person has not put any effort to search for an answer herself. Those who really want to learn would put effort into try and look for an answer themselves until they get completely stuck. To become a smart software engineer, we want to keep learning no matter how many times we run into a wall. In order to keep learning, we need to be able to ask smart questions that invoke high-quality answers that we can learn greatly from. 


<h1>Bad Question</h1>

In order to be able to ask smart questions, we always need to keep in mind to be in the shoes of a person who will review the question and possibly answer it. Not-so-smart questions could be ignored or replied in a negative way, since not many people would enjoy wasting time answering bad questions. 
As an example, questions like this [Bad Example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36355927/setter-doesnt-work) already can be perceived as a low-quality question just by looking at the subject line and is likely to be ignored by many potential respondents. Most importantly, the question itself is not a question because the author is stating that the code does not work. The example also lack of clear, grammatical and correctly spelled language, which would again give bad impression to the reviewers. To add on, the author must provide a minimal, but sufficient amount of code to explain the bug so that the readers can understand. Overall, the question seems to be posted and written in a rush, with no good thought put into it.  
As this example shows, bad questions often do not receive well-established answers. In fact, the post is closed as off-topic by some users for reasons like ones explained earlier. The only response the post has seem to be written in a careless manner. 


<h1>Good Question</h1>

Unlike the example above, a high-quality questions have high-quality answers. Here is an example of a good question that is asked in a smart way. First of all, the example question is very easy to understand. It explicitly and precisely describes what the problem and the question is. The author also explains the problem in a chronological order, explaining what she has been doing prior to the problem and what part of code she changed when the problem occurred. 
For this question, there are a lot of well-established and detailed answers that help the author understand the concept of equalities in Java. The respondents of the question also sound eager to share their knowledge to the author. Although the examples provided are merely a couple of many questions asked, high-quality questions seem to attract high-quality responses. 


<h1>To Become the Smart One</h1>

The purpose of asking smart questions is to learn from the answers provided by the contributors. Bad questions are unlikely to receive high-quality answers. Therefore, to become a smart software engineer, one must learn how to ask questions in a smart way. As long as a person is persistent and eager to learn, pitfalls of bad questions could be avoided, and will likely to succeed in learning from others.
