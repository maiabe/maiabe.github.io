My final project for ICS 111 class was the first group programming project that I have ever participated into. We used Java programming with Eclipse, and our final project was to create anything using the skills we have learned over the semester.  My group created a simple shooting game, where the squares on the screen shoot downwards and the triangle which is the player-controlled object that can shoot back at the squares. When all of the squares are shot by the triangle, the player can proceed to the next level. We created three levels, where bullet speed that the enemies shoot at you increases as the level goes up. The player has 20 lives, and can earn 1 point each time the player hits the enemy with its bullets. 


For the project, we planned out what everybody’s role is going to be to complete the project, but it became harder when one of our group members left the team before we wrote any of the code for the project. Despite an unexpected work load, my group was able to complete the project. I contributed to creating enemies and making them shoot bullets at a certain speed, making enemies disappear when they get shot, randomize bullet speeds accordingly, making levels of difficulty, and adding sound effects. 


Through this project, the most important thing I learned was to work as a group. Combining somebody else’s code with yours was a harder task than I thought, since everybody writes code differently and you have to understand their code. When our combined code was not working and we got stuck, I read the code and went over it many times to understand what is going on and later I was able to fix the error. Other than group work, I learned basic Java programming skills through this project such as being able to utilize for loop, making classes for the objects, scoping code in the correct way, adding images and sound effects, making objects user-controllable, etc.
